Following the Apple WWDC Keynote there are a number of things this Apple fan wants to get to keep happy with my existing Apple equipment and to stay current as well.


### Wants:

#### Hardware
  - Homepod $350
  This thing looks so awesome!  I surely want one (or more).  But how will it mix in with my existing Sonos System?  I also use AirPlay in my home.  The HomePad will use a new revision of the protocol: AirPlay 2.  The relase of AirPlay v2 has implications for those of us who use AirPlay v1 with our older equipment such as AirPort Express, Apple TV and older Macs perhaps running older Mac operating systems.

  - iPad  10.5 inches  $650 - $1100
  Looks pretty tasty.

  - iMac Pro $5k
  I'll never be able to afford this but I desire it anyway.

  - iMac upgrades
  They will be faster CPU and fusion drives standard.  Also now will have USB-C plugs.  This is nice but won't affect me until I can afford to buy a used one in a few years.  (sigh)
  Entry price is a nice $1100

  - New full extended keys wireless Keyboard $129
  This is great.  I like a big keyboard and now I can get one without the wires.  I assume it uses the new keyboard design.

#### Software & Services

  - High Sierra
  The new operating sytem for my Mac.  Woot!  I'm high on it already.
  Faster Safari, enhanced privacy, blocks auto-play content.  Mail reduced footprint for stored messages.  Photos: Chronologic display, Metadata synchronization via iCloud, new edit tools.  synchronization with Pixelmator!!  Third party printing of photos.  APFS will be the new file system. Faster.  New H.265 video codec.  If your computer can run Sierra then it will run High Sierra.  That includes Macs as old as 7 years!  

  - iOS v11
  I'll call this iOS with the Finder!
  It won't work on iPhone 5 nor iPhone 5C nor 4th gen iPad (A6 chips 32bit architecture)  Looks like the transition to 64bit is being completed with this OS.  It *will* run on iPhone 5s and newer, iPad mini 2 and newer, iPad Air and newer, and the sixth-generation iPod touch.

  - Amazon Prime on Apple TV
  This is great.  I've been using the crappy UI on my Sony DVD player to get Amazon Prime.  It will be nice to stick with the Apple TV for this.  Will it be retrofitted to the 2nd or 3rd generation Apple TV?

  - Apple App Store redesign
  About time!  Not sure I like a _Tab oriented_ design but it can't be as bad as the old one.

  - Apple person to person payments
  Makes it simple to split the bill when out with a group.

  - Siri Translation
  Douglas Adams' dream of bable-fish is almost here. English to: Chinese, French, German, Italian & Spanish.    

  - Do Not Disturb while driving!  
  Hooray.  Boost in safety.  This one will save lives!  And you can tell it: I'm not driving.  And Auto Response!!  "Im drivng with DND turned on. I'll see your message when I get where I'm going."

  - Speaker control via Home Kit!





### Retrofit needs
  - Airport Express $99
  Will Apple release a firmware update for this which will allow it to talk AirPlay v2?  I might need one of these just to maintain ability to play music with AirPlay v1 too.

  - iOS v11 will not run 32 bit Apps.  
  very very many old apps will need to be updated by their developers.  What about your favorite old app that you use but the developer no longer supports or updates?  You'll likely have to choose to dump the app or stay with iOS 10.  Tough decisions.
